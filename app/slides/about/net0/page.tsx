            <li>
              There are multiple hops across many servers, all using energy and
              one website can load any number of resources behind the scenes

            <li>
              But perhaps the biggest issue is that these emissions are not
              obvious and very difficult to measure

              It's very common to have documention when building digital
              products, so it's nice to have that built in
